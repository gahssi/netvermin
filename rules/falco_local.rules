- rule: Suspicious Execution from Temporary Directory
  desc: >
    Alert when a process executes a binary from a temporary directory (e.g., /Temp or /temp),
    which is unusual for system software. Parent process details are included to help pinpoint suspicious activity.
  condition: >
    evt.type = execve and (proc.exepath contains "/Temp" or proc.exepath contains "/temp")
  output: >
    Suspicious execution from temporary directory detected: exe=%proc.exepath; command=%proc.cmdline; parent_cmd=%proc.pcmdline; pid=%proc.pid
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [worm, execution]

- rule: Host Drift Detected (chmod)
  desc: >
    Alert when file permissions are changed using chmod (or its variants) to add execute permissions.
    The output includes both current and parent process details.
  condition: >
    evt.type in (chmod, fchmod, fchmodat) and evt.rawres >= 0 and ((evt.arg.mode contains "S_IXUSR") or (evt.arg.mode contains "S_IXGRP") or (evt.arg.mode contains "S_IXOTH"))
  output: >
    Host drift detected: file=%fd.name now has execute permission (mode=%evt.arg.mode) modified by process=%proc.name (command=%proc.cmdline); parent_cmd=%proc.pcmdline; pid=%proc.pid
  priority: ERROR

- rule: Host Drift Detected (open+create)
  desc: >
    Alert when a new executable file is created via open or creat that is marked executable.
    The alert includes full process and parent process details.
  condition: >
    evt.type in (open, openat, openat2, creat) and evt.rawres >= 0 and evt.is_open_exec = true
  output: >
    Host drift detected (open+create): file=%evt.arg.filename, name=%evt.arg.name, mode=%evt.arg.mode, evt=%evt.type; process=%proc.name (command=%proc.cmdline); parent_cmd=%proc.pcmdline; pid=%proc.pid
  priority: ERROR

- rule: Python Writing/Creating in /home Directory
  desc: >
    Alert when a Python process writes or creates a file under the /home directory.
    This is useful to flag potential worm behavior (e.g., dropping or modifying files) and includes key parent/child fields.
  condition: >
    ( (evt.type in (open, openat) and evt.is_open_write = true) or evt.type = creat )
    and proc.name in (python, python3)
    and evt.arg.path startswith "/home/"
  output: >
    Python process %proc.name writing/creating file: %evt.arg.path; command=%proc.cmdline; parent_cmd=%proc.pcmdline; exe_path=%proc.exepath; pid=%proc.pid
  priority: CRITICAL

- rule: Detect OS Fingerprinting Commands
  desc: >
    Detects execution of commands used for active OS fingerprinting.
  condition: >
    evt.type = execve and (
      (proc.name = "uname" and (proc.cmdline contains "-s" or proc.cmdline contains "-a" or proc.cmdline contains "-r"))
      or (proc.name = "lsb_release" and proc.cmdline contains "-a")
      or (proc.name = "cat" and (proc.cmdline contains "/etc/os-release" or proc.cmdline contains "/etc/issue"))
      or (proc.name = "hostname")
